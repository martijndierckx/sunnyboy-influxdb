# Push SMA Sunny Boy data to InfluxDB

A node webservice that pulls data from the Sunny Boy webinterface and pushes it to InfluxDB.

I've had very little time to clean things up. So I decided to just publish this first draft.
If you can help cleaning things up, and separating the config. Feel free :-)
=======
1. Change config in docker-compose.yml
2. run ‘docker-compose build‘
3. run ‘docker-compose up‘
